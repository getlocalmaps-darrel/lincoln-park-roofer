## Problems Found (5 total)
- **[Critical]** No Neighborhood / City Pages -- You have 0 city-specific pages. Businesses that create pages for each neighborhood they serve rank significantly better in 'near me' and '[service] in [city]' searches. Google and AI reward geo-targeted content.
- **[Critical]** No "Near Me" Search Hooks -- Voice search users say 'find a [service] near me.' Without 'near me' content in your headings and pages, voice assistants and AI skip you for these high-intent local searches.
- **[Critical]** No Service Schema -- Google has no structured list of your services. Service schema tells search engines and AI exactly what you offer so they can match you to the right searches.
- **[Critical]** Slow Page Load (8.0s) -- Your main content takes 8.0 seconds to appear. Visitors leave after 3 seconds. That's customers calling your competitors.
- **[Medium]** Meta Description Too Long -- Your site description gets cut off in Google search results. Visitors see an incomplete sentence, which looks unprofessional.
