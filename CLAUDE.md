🔗 [6] NATURAL LINK FLUIDITY & AUTHORITY
Authority Link Placement (CRITICAL): - Link 'Official 2026 Michigan Residential Building Code' to https://share.google/zkQ5YtBJETVEHBJvO.

RANDOMIZE placement within the second paragraph (Start, Middle, or End). Never use the same spot twice in a row.

Internal Link Rotation: - Every city page MUST link once to the following, but ROTATE the anchor text and placement:

Repair: (e.g., "emergency roof fix", "certified roof repair", "leak detection") → roof-repair.html

Replacement: (e.g., "new roof installation", "full shingle replacement") → roof-replacement.html

Rejuvenation: (e.g., "asphalt shingle restoration") → https://lincolnparkroofing.com/roof-rejuvenation.html

Insurance: (e.g., "storm damage claims") → https://lincolnparkroofing.com/roof-insurance-claim-lincoln-park-mi.html

New Build: (e.g., "new construction roofing") → https://lincolnparkroofing.com/new-roof-construction.html

Rule of Two: Never put more than two internal links in the same paragraph.

Homepage Backlink: Every page MUST include one contextual body-text link where "Lincoln Park Roofing" links to index.html. This should be a natural mention in the intro or first body paragraph, NOT in the header/footer/logo.

Anchor Text Mixing (CRITICAL): Each internal link target should appear only ONCE per page. Across pages, NEVER reuse the same anchor text for the same destination. Rotate aggressively — examples for roof-repair.html:
- Page A: "roof leak repair"
- Page B: "licensed roofing contractor"
- Page C: "emergency shingle fix"
- Page D: "certified leak detection"
- Page E: "professional roof repair"
No two pages should use identical anchor text for the same internal link. Mix phrasing, synonyms, and natural variations so every page reads uniquely.
